# House-Prices
This project predicts house prices through data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation of categorical features. A pipeline with preprocessing, scaling, and regression (XGBoost) was built. Hyperparameters were tuned via RandomizedSearchCV, and performance was evaluated using RÂ² and RMSE.
